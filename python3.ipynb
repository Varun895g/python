        "\n",

        "A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. It can have any number of arguments but only one expression. The expression is evaluated and returned when the function is called.\n",

        "##9-Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
        "Purpose\n",

        "Functional Programming: Emphasize the use of functions to process data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Uses:\n",
        "Lambda functions are often used with map() for concise, inline transformations.\n",

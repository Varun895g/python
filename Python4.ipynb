        "## 1-What is the difference between interpreted and compiled language?\n",
        "Interpreted Languages: These languages are executed line-by-line by an interpreter. Examples include Python, JavaScript, and Ruby. They are generally easier to debug and more flexible, but can be slower in execution compared to compiled languages.\n",
        "Compiled Languages: These languages are translated into machine code by a compiler before execution. Examples include C, C++, and Rust. They tend to be faster and more efficient but require a separate compilation step before running the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2- What id exception handling in python?\n",
        "Exception handling in Python is a way to handle errors gracefully without crashing the program. It uses the try, except, else, and finally blocks to catch and manage exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3- What is purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "The finally block in Python is used to execute code that should run no matter what, whether an exception is raised or not. It's often used for cleanup actions, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4- What is logging in python?\n",
        "Logging is a way to track events that happen when some software runs. The logging module in Python allows you to report status, error, and informational messages. Itâ€™s useful for debugging and monitoring applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5-What is significance of the _ _del_ _ method in python?\n",
        "The __del__ method in Python is a destructor method. It is called when an object is about to be destroyed, allowing you to clean up resources like closing files or network connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## 6-What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python\n",
        "import module: Imports the entire module. You need to prefix the module name when accessing its functions or classes.\n",
        "from module import name: Imports specific functions or classes from a module. You can use them directly without the module prefix.\n",
        "\n",
        "##7- How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "You can handle multiple exceptions using a tuple in the except block.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 8- What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "The with statement is used for resource management and ensures that resources are properly cleaned up after use. It is commonly used when working with files.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "##9- What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "Multithreading: Involves multiple threads within the same process. It is useful for I/O-bound tasks but can be limited by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiprocessing: Involves multiple processes, each with its own memory space. It is useful for CPU-bound tasks and can bypass the GIL.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 10-What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "Debugging: Helps identify and fix issues.\n",
        "Monitoring: Tracks the application's behavior and performance.\n",
        "Auditing: Keeps a record of events for security and compliance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 11- What is memory management in Python\n",
        "Memory management in Python involves the allocation and deallocation of memory to ensure efficient use of resources. Python uses a private heap space for memory management, and the built-in garbage collector handles the automatic recycling of unused memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 12-  What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python\n",
        "Try Block: Code that might raise an exception is placed inside a try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "Except Block: Code to handle the exception is placed inside an except block.\n",
        "\n",
        "Else Block: Code that runs if no exception occurs is placed inside an else block.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally Block: Code that runs no matter what, often used for cleanup, is placed inside a finally block.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 13- Why is memory management important in Python\n",
        "Efficient memory management is crucial to prevent memory leaks and ensure that applications run smoothly without consuming excessive resources. It helps in optimizing performance and maintaining system stability\n",
        "\n",
        "## 14-What is the role of try and except in exception handling\n",
        "try Block: Contains code that might raise an exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "except Block: Contains code to handle the exception if it occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## 15-  How does Python's garbage collection system work\n",
        "Python's garbage collection system automatically manages memory by reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use. It uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to detect and clean up circular references.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## 16- What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling\n",
        "The else block in exception handling is executed if no exceptions are raised in the try block. It is useful for code that should run only if the try block succeeds.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 17- What are the common logging levels in Python\n",
        "DEBUG: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "INFO: Confirmation that things are working as expected.\n",

        "\n",
        "Multiprocessing: A module that allows the creation of multiple processes, each with its own memory space. It is cross-platform and provides a higher-level interface for process-based parallelism.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 19- What is the importance of closing a file in Python\n",
        "Closing a file in Python is crucial because it ensures that all data is properly written to the file and that resources are released. It prevents data corruption and frees up system resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 20- What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python\n",
        "file.read(): Reads the entire file or a specified number of bytes.\n",
